# Cracker

Reverses Minecraft seed strings from a given seed with regex patterns.

## Compiling from source

If you are on another platform, compile the binary yourself to try it out:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tropicbliss/cracker
cd cracker
cargo build --release
```

Compiling from source requires the latest stable version of Rust. Older Rust versions may be able to compile `cracker`, but they are not guaranteed to keep working.

The binary will be located in `target/release`.

## Usage

Use the `--help` command line flag.
